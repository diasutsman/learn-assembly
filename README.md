# learn-assembly
Stored all of my assembly learning stuff because it seems fun and I need to learn something actually hard so that I can get paid high.

1. ReAssemble assembly code into ELF file (whatever that mean) 
as asem.s -o asem.o

2. Compile to be executable
gcc -o asem asem.o -nostdlib -static
